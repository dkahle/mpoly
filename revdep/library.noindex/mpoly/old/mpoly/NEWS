Version 1.0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Add is.unipoly(), a predicate for univariate polynomials.
* Add solve_unipoly(), a mpoly wrapper for polyroot().
* plug() now works on mpolyLists.

CHANGES

* as.function.mpoly() and as.function.mpolyList() no longer message
  when the resulting function arguments are clear.



Version 1.0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES

* A bug in scientific notation causing mp() to hang has been fixed. 
  (Thanks @sommars)
* Move README from figures/ to tools/
* Add https:// for paper reference



Version 1.0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* as.mpoly() methods for lm objects using poly(, raw = TRUE) statements
  now works properly.

CHANGES

* the print.mpoly and print.mpolyList methods now print with cat() instead 
  of message().  they also accept a silent argument, in which case the 
  output is suppressed; characters are returned silently. the argument order
  has changed so that stars follows varorder and order.
  
FIXES

* a stray browser() statement was removed from as.mpoly().



Version 1.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* you can now pass * for multiplication in mp, so that mp("x*x") works 
  properly.

CHANGES

* all java stuff has been removed; see the m2r package for grobner basis
  computations.




Version 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* mpoly now provided functions for extracting the leading term (LT),
  leading coefficient (LC), leading monomial (LM), and arbitrary 
  term (as in p[3]).  You can also compute the multidegree of a 
  polynomial (multideg).
* new function exponents extracts the exponents of an mpoly.
* new functions homogenize, dehomogenize, homogeneous_components extract
  those components of a multivariate polynomial.
* as.function() now returns vectorized functions when the polynomial(s) 
  are only of one variable.

CHANGES

* terms.mpoly is now deprecated, use monomials.
* reorder.mpoly now defaults to the lex order.




Version 1.0.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

* Versioned directly modulo very minor CRAN changes from 0.1.1 for CRAN 
  consistency.




Version 0.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* A new function called plug allows users to plug values into indeterminates in mpoly objects.
* mpoly now imports the polynom and orthopolynom packages, and has as.mpoly methods to parse their objects into mpoly objects.
* mpoly now imports reshape2 for some visualization stuff.
* A new function called chebyshev allows users to compute Chebyshev polynomials.  This is based on orthopolynom.
* New functions called bernstein and bernsteinApprox allow users to compute Bernstein polynomials and approximate functions with Bernstein polynomials, see examples.  A special as.function method exists for evaluating these in a numerically stable way.
* A new function called bezier allows users to compute the polynomials associated with Bezier curves.  A special as.function method exists for evaluating these in a numerically stable way via de Casteljau's algorithm, based on a new function called bezierFunction (exported).
* Several new predicate functions are exported.
* ggplot2 is now imported.

CHANGES

* The internals of tuples have been changed, but the user shouldn't expect to see them.


FIXES 

* A bug in mp functions where non-parenthetical exponents in parenthetical expressions were mis-parsed has been fixed.
* round.mpoly now drops terms rounded to have 0 coefficients.
* mpolyList now can be used inside functions and other environments (thanks @gitlongor)


Version 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* is.linear function.
* round now has a method applicable to mpoly objects that rounds the coefficients.  this is particularly nice in combination with as.mpoly.lm.
* Hard braces are now allowed for variables, e.g. x[1,1]

CHANGES

* Vastly enhanced mp parser based on stringr 9.0.0 (now dependent on stringi).
* Tests added.
* Description file updated for CRAN's standards.



Version 0.0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* Parenthetical expressions are now handled.

CHANGES

* Permutations now returns a better ordered listing of the permutations of a set.  It also allows for the more flexible specification of (e.g.) permutations(5) for permutations(1:5).

FIXES

* Some negative parsing in mp has been fixed.



Version 0.0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

* Division symbols in mp now return an error.
* mpoly now has a GPL-2 license.

FIXES

* Fixed a glitch in print.mpoly that made mp("-1 + y") print as "-1 1  +  y".
* mpolyList now works on single elements, either a mpoly object (converting it to a mpolyList) or a call to mp.
* mp now properly handles constants raised to powers.


Version 0.0.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXES

* Fixed an issue with as.mpoly (and is.mpoly.lm).



Version 0.0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* as.mpoly method now defined for lm objects which makes an mpoly object out of a linear model.



Version 0.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
